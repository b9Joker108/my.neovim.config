# my.neovim.config

This is a dedicated repository for my Neovim configuration. I decided to place it in its own 
dedicated repository, rather than in my generic and inclusive Dotfiles repository, for ease 
of discovery and visibility.

I am new to scripting, coding and programming. I have specifically chosen Android hand-held 
devices for my scripting, programming and digital endeavours, due to their global ubiquity, 
affordability, extreme ease of portability, customisability and functionality. Termux is the 
most widely used terminal emulator for Android, and is well documented, well supported, and has an 
active development and help community, supporting its use and uptake. For these reasons, Termux 
is central to most, if not all, of my digital and online endeavours. I am documenting and 
diarising my endeavours and learnings with the express intentionality of making them interrogable,
to inform the process and technological uptake and adaptation of others. I am writing a book that
aims to be roadmap, to usefully inform others and to showcase, how to deftly and adeptly acquire 
scripting and hacking propensity in Bash and Zsh, within the Termux terminal emulator environment,
upon Android handheld devices. The example of engineering and iterating, a bespoke, integrated 
developmental environment (IDE), is central and primary to the road this roadmap charts.

If not a user, I have been aware of vi for quite some time, as well as Vim its vibrant fork. But, 
only in late 2023, did I become aware of Neovim through researching potential and prospective 
Android IDEs. Resting somewhat upon intuition and informed faith, I resolved on a Termux 
commandline text editor, that cauld be readily and freely augmented into a bespoke and 
personalised IDE ecosystem, that is functional and powerful and extensible according to an 
individuals workflow, processes and requirements, and yields, maximises and acclimatises, to their
idiosyncrasies. It was due to YouTube, and ..., that my interest in Neovim was initially set and sealed.

# Aspiration for a bespoke Termux commandline IDE

My aspiration, is to create an excellent, intelligent and personalised IDE environment in Termux 
on Android for shell scripting (Bash, Zsh, Sh, Fish, Nushell) and Python programming (initially), 
using Neovim and Lua plugins. I require a combination of plugins for various functionalities such 
as syntax highlighting, linting, autocompletion, git control, etcetera.

# Thanks to YouTube and Kickstart

I initially started my foray into the world of Lua plugins for Neovim, with the Neovim 
configuration kickstarter tool, called Kickstart, and hosted on GitHub, specifically created 
and named, due to its purpose and ain, in providing users new to Neovim, a curated list of Lua 
plugins deemed centeal and primary, to a beginner's journey on starting to use Neovim. I initially
discovered Kickstart on YouTube, and had some problems with it, as one of the plugins in the 
configuration file were not compatible with Android. I have not deleted the Lua plugin code, but 
merely commented it, to make it ineffectual. The plugin that is incompatible to Android, is still 
included in the following Kickstart list, that was the version of Kickstart that I implemented in
late 2023. In addition to the plugin that is incompatible with Android architecture, there were 
also a minimum of Lua syntax errors in the configuration file. The troublesome plugin and the 
syntax issues, necessitate troubleshooting and whereby facilitated new skills, as they were 
integrated into mThe Neovim subreddit was a readily available and accessible community that 
provided support and assistance in repairing the syntax errors in my Lua plugin Neovim 
configuration file: init.lua.

## The Kickstart Plugins List, at my uptake and implementation of the project, in late 2023

The following Kickstart plugin list, text and formating (along with other nested content and code,
that I have edited, re-worked, re-positionedand and re-purposed), was intelligently generated by
the 'readme' process inbuilt, with much foresight, into the functionality of 
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). I must declare, that I am somewhat in awe, of the simple, powerful 
and elegant functionality of this GitHub hosted website and its markdown. I intend to interrogate 
its markdown, learning from it and pilphering, as necessary.

## Install Instructions

Note, this Neovim configuration and its README.md, are dynamic evolving systems and living 
documents, and are bound to change without notice, according to my own whimsy. Given this caveat, 
if you would like to install this config, or give it a testdrive, please find the following code 
to facilitate that, automatically and intelligently generated by the truly awesome:
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). For probity, I recommed that you note the date you implemented it 
for your own records, and this aids auditing its potential makeup, if any parties are interested 
in that information, in future. It is just best-practice and best-modelled.

 > Install requires Neovim 0.9+. Always review the code before installing a configuration.

Clone the repository and install the plugins:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:b9Joker108/my.neovim.config ~/.config/b9Joker108/my.neovim.config
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
```

Open Neovim with this config:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim
```

The deft and dextrous nature of Termux, Neovim and Lua as keyplayers in the Android ecosystem, are 
augmented powerfully by Tmux, which completes the list of keyplayers, in the bespoke IDE 
commandline playfield.

## Weaving a Bespoke IDE Tapestry: Termux, Tmux, Neovim, and the Power of Lua

Imagine an IDE woven from the colourful threads of commandline powerhouses: Termux, Tmux, Neovim, 
and the boundless tapestry of Lua. This isn't your run-of-the-mill proprietary development 
environment; it's a meticulously crafted workspace, sculpted to your desires, and adaptable to 
your workflows. Let's delve into the potentiality and magic of this integrated ecosystem:

**Termux:** Your mobile portal. This Android app grants access to a GNU/Linux environment, 
complete with a package manager and familiar tools like the GNU *NIX mainstay, and other 
commandline FOSS toolsets. It's the foundation stone, the bedrock upon which everything rests.

**Tmux:** The master of sessions and windows. Tmux orchestrates your workspace, splitting panes,
stacking windows, and letting you navigate with lightning speed. Think of it as the architect, 
defining the layout and flow of your IDE.

**Neovim:** The vi or Vim you know, except on designer party-drugs, and further augmented by 
intelligent design and impassioned engineering. Neovim takes the legendary Vim editor (a fork of 
the pioneering and ever-popular vi), giving it a shot-in-the-arm, that results in hacktastic 
superpowers. Extensive plugin support, and a playground for Lua scripting, and asynchronous 
operations, transform Neovim into a versatile and limitlessly customisable, bespoke IDE platform.
The fundamental building block in a GNU/Linux environment is code, and the vehicle of this code is 
the textfile. This textfile forum, yields the granularity and power of GNU/Linux, which was 
fundamentally inherited from pioneering *NIX., definable and redefinableNeovim is the canvas, 
ready to be painted with the vibrant strokes of plugins and customizations.

**Lua:** The brush that paints a thousand extensions. This scripting language unlocks Neovim's 
true potential. Imagine:

* **Language servers:** Syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting for any language, woven
  seamlessly into your workflow.
* **Project management:** Track tasks, manage dependencies, and automate builds, all within your
  editor.
* **Distraction-free writing:** Immerse yourself in pure text, with focus timers and minimal UI
  elements.
* **Custom keybindings and macros:** Craft shortcuts that dance to your fingertips, speeding up
  your every action.

This is just a glimpse into the boundless possibilities. With Lua, the only limit is your 
imagination.

**Critically Narrating the Tapestry:**

While this bespoke IDE boasts immense power, it comes with its own challenges. The learning curve 
can be steep, and esoteric, especially for those unfamiliar with the commandline and vi or Vim. 
Debugging Lua scripts can be tricky, and finding the right combination of plugins can feel 
overwhelming. Additionally, Termux's resource limitations might not suit resource-intensive 
projects.

**Showcasing the Tapestry's Brilliance:**

But for those who persevere, the rewards are manifold. Imagine coding on your phone, tablet or 
other hand-held device, with a full-fledged, yet bespoke and idiosyncratically augmented IDE, in 
your pocket, briefcase, carrybag and/or backpack. Picture seamlessly switching between devices, 
your environment consistent across platforms. Witness the thrill of crafting an IDE that bends to 
your will, a reflection of your unique coding style.

**In Conclusion:**

The integrated ecosystem of Termux, Tmux, Neovim, and Lua is not just a collection of tools; it's 
a blank canvas begging to be splashed with creativity. It's an invitation to weave your own 
bespoke IDE tapestry, a testament to your coding prowess and a playground for your imagination. 
So, are you ready to take the plunge and craft your dream development environment?
