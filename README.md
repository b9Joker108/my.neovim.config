**To oversee this project and its realisation, I invoke Sri Yanta, unreservedly and with 
specificity.**

This image is an anionic, devotional representation, of [Sri Yantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Yantra) , and it has been inset, with devotion. 'Sri Yantra' 
(Devanagari: श्री यन्त्र, IAST: śrī yantra) is a Sanskrit term, that is pronounced somewhere inbetween
'sri' and 'shri' in most dialects of contemporary English, and denotes a specific entity with its
divine personality and agency, and/or its specific prana or lifeforce, and that which is 
sacrosanct, and set apart as holy, sacred, worshipful and divine. 'Yantra', is pronounced in two
syllables, with stress on the first: 'YARN-tra', and may be usefully rendered in the English 
language, as: 'instrument', 'machine', 'mechanism', 'invention','fabrication', 'machination', 
'combobulation', and denotes something, or more appropriately a specific someone or entity, that 
is at-once 'systemic' and 'combinatory'. These lexical items form a paradigm, which frame, map and 
usefully inform, the semantic field for this Sanskritic cultural token or artefact, in the 
English. Therefore, Sri Yanta may (usefully) be understood, as a worshipful and sacred instrument 
or machine, that has divine personality and agency. 

**A technical annotation:** I tried a number of different permutations of markdown code snippets 
to resize Sri Yanta. When this was ineffectual, I even pragmatically endeavoured to externally 
resize the grapheme, and upload and embed. Mysteriously and perplexingly, the size of Sri Yantra
remained constant. I interpret this as both the divine will and agency of Sri Yanta, intersecting 
with my technical ineptitude and tomfoolery. 

# Evocation

**Devanagari:**

वज्रतुंड महाकाय सूर्यकोटि समप्रभ
निर्विघ्नं कुरु मे देवं सर्वकार्येषु सर्वदा

**IAST:**

vajratuṇḍa mahākāya sūryakoṭi samaprabha
nirvighnaṃ kuru me devam sarvakāryeṣu sarvadā

**Meaning:**

"O Lord with a diamond trunk, huge body, and brilliance like the sun, please make all my tasks free 
of obstacles always."

This verse is a prayer to Lord Ganesha, the Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism) ishta-devata (tutelary deity) 
of wisdom and remover of obstacles. It is often recited at the beginning of any new task or undertaking
to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha.

Here is a breakdown of the meaning of each word in the verse:

* **Vajratunda:** "diamond trunk" - refers to Lord Ganesha's trunk, which is said to be as strong as
  a diamond.
* **Mahakaya:** "huge body" - refers to Lord Ganesha's large and powerful body.
* **Suryakoti samaprabha:** "brilliance like the sun" - refers to Lord Ganesha's radiant aura, which
  is said to be as bright as the sun.
* **Nirvighnam:** "free of obstacles" - refers to the ability of Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles
  from our path.
* **Kuru:** "make" - a verb that means to do or create something.
* **Me:** "me" - the first person singular pronoun.
* **Devam:** "god" - refers to Lord Ganesha.
* **Sarvakāryeṣu:** "in all tasks" - refers to all the tasks or undertakings that we may have.
* **Sarvadā:** "always" - refers to all times or at all times.

# my.neovim.config

This is a dedicated repository for my Neovim configuration. In reality, it includes a roadmap for 
the realisation of a bespoke IDE within the augmented environment, of an Android operating system. 
By documenting this roadmap, I intend for it to provide feedback to the developer community and 
despell the arcane esotericism of this process for neophytes. This repository is the attendant 
construct and mechanism, for another repository, that enshrines a roadmap on shell scripting in 
Bash and Zsh, that I am crafting and codifying as I acquire *NIX shell scripting skills and their 
functional and pragmatic propensities. This second shell-scripting roadmap, though quite developed
(in theory), is yet to be roadtested (in practice), and its traverse and traveil, charted and 
documented. As it is still under development and depends on the practical implementation of this 
repository, it is yet to be in publishable version, housed in its own GitHub repository, herewith. 
The two roadmap repositories are to be engaged and resourced in tandem. I decided to place this 
config and its attendant information, it in its own dedicated repository, rather than in my 
generic and inclusive Dotfiles repository, for ease of discovery and visibility, and also for the 
functionality and discoverability of its future project website, which will showcase this 
keystone, in the roadtested, shell scripting roadmap, I am divining.

I am new to scripting, coding and programming. I have specifically chosen Android hand-held 
devices for my scripting, programming and digital endeavours, due to their global ubiquity, 
affordability, extreme ease of portability, customisability and functionality. Termux is the 
most widely used terminal emulator for Android, and is well documented, well supported, and has an 
active development and help community, supporting its use and uptake. For these reasons, Termux 
is central to most, if not all, of my digital and online endeavours. I am documenting and 
diarising my endeavours and learnings with the express intentionality of making them interrogable,
to inform the process and technological uptake and adaptation of others. I am writing a book that
aims to be roadmap, to usefully inform others and to showcase, how to deftly and adeptly acquire 
scripting and hacking propensity in Bash and Zsh, within the Termux terminal emulator environment,
upon Android handheld devices. The example of engineering and iterating, a bespoke, integrated 
developmental environment (IDE), is central and primary to the road this roadmap charts.

If not a user, I have been aware of vi for quite some time, as well as Vim its vibrant fork. But, 
only in late 2023, did I become aware of Neovim through researching potential and prospective 
Android IDEs. Resting somewhat upon intuition and informed faith, I resolved on a Termux 
commandline text editor, that cauld be readily and freely augmented into a bespoke and 
personalised IDE ecosystem, that is functional and powerful and extensible according to an 
individuals workflow, processes and requirements, and yields, maximises and acclimatises, to their
idiosyncrasies. It was due to YouTube, and ..., that my interest in Neovim was initially set and sealed.

# Aspiration for a bespoke Termux commandline IDE

My aspiration, is to create an excellent, intelligent and personalised IDE environment in Termux 
on Android for shell scripting (Bash, Zsh, Sh, Fish, Nushell) and Python programming (initially), 
using Neovim and Lua plugins. I require a combination of plugins for various functionalities such 
as syntax highlighting, linting, autocompletion, git control, etcetera.

# Thanks to YouTube and Kickstart

I initially started my foray into the world of Lua plugins for Neovim, with the Neovim 
configuration kickstarter tool, aptly named [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), and hosted on GitHub, specifically created and named, due to its purpose 
and ain, in providing users new to Neovim, a curated list of Lua plugins deemed centeal and 
primary, to a beginner's journey on starting to use Neovim. I initially discovered Kickstart on 
YouTube, and had some problems with it, as one of the plugins in the configuration file were not
compatible with Android. I have not deleted the Lua plugin code, but merely commented it, to make 
it ineffectual. The plugin that is incompatible to Android, is still included in the following 
Kickstart list, that was the version of Kickstart that I implemented in late 2023. In addition to 
the plugin that is incompatible with Android architecture, there were also a minimum of Lua syntax
errors in the configuration file. The troublesome plugin and the syntax issues, necessitate 
troubleshooting and whereby facilitated new skills, as they were integrated into the Neovim 
subreddit was a readily available and accessible community that provided support and assistance
in repairing the syntax errors in my Lua plugin Neovim configuration file: init.lua.

## The Kickstart Plugins List, at my uptake and implementation of the project, in late 2023

The following Kickstart plugin list, text and formating (along with other nested content and code,
that I have edited, re-worked, re-positionedand and re-purposed), was intelligently generated by
the 'readme' process inbuilt, with much foresight, into the functionality of 
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). I must declare, that I am somewhat in awe, of the simple, powerful 
and elegant functionality of this GitHub hosted website and its markdown. I intend to interrogate 
its markdown, learning from it and pilphering, as necessary.

Generative AI, to edify, identified this subsection, which is unpopulated with the version of 
Kickstart that I commenced my Neovim foray with. This informs me, that this is a plugin 
functionality, I will need to research and populate.

# My Personal Issues with Kickstart Due to My Ineptitude

I have learnt much about Lua, often fixing issues with the Kickstart Neovim configuration, more than using it. I have noted a lot of developers on YouTube saying directly or in passing, at once both jocular and serious, that they spent more time tinkering with their Neovim configurations, than they do coding. Tinkering with Un*x/*NIX configurations, is a joy, addictive, a powerful asset, but also aa serious time-sink and hence, also a liability. There is definitely more of an upside, than a downside, given the granularity and customisability. I am often endeavouring to develop the base configuration of Kickstart, and as a result, my Neovim configuration is often broken and unusable. Neovim doesn't load if the syntax of the configuration is unsound. Lua is unforgiving. As a result of my Neovim configuration being unusable, I often fall back upon editing with vanilla Vim, without any plugins. Just recently, whilst endeavouring to fix another nooby error with Kickstart, a person assising me on Reddit, within the Neovim subreddit, posted a flagged and annotated version of the current version of Kickstart. I didn't commence with Kickstart long ago, only a few months, and I saw in the annotated example, that it had been significantly added to, and iterated, since the version I commenced. I haven't yet altered my currenr broken local installation, and implemented the new Kickstart version. I have kind of been playing hide and seek with it and doing other things. I have been focusing on integrating the Dotly dotfiles management system and framework locally. This is actually a significant endeavour given that I have circa eighteen (18) different shells installed in my beloved Termux, and I have also been coding snippets of shell functions, as well as shell scripts, most days. I will delete my current broken install of Kickstart, and install the new one.

# Dotfyle website 

I discovered the website Dotfyle, from the Neovim website. Both the Dotfyle and Neovim projects'
websites sourcecode and domain is provided by GitHub, and are  housed in repositories therein. I
plan on using both of them to inform the development of my personal GitHub website. The Dotfyle 
website is an excellent interactive resource for 
finding and comparing Neovim plugins, as well as referencing, resourcing and comparing other 
peoples' Neovim configuration files, it is located at the following address: 

https://dotfyle.com (accessed: Sunday, April 07, 2024)

***********************************************************************************************

This YouTube video on Neovim configuration, showcases the developer, Josean's amazing insight into 
Neovim, the Neovim plugin ecosystem, their own Lua programming excellent, and foregrounds how to 
practically employ Neovim in a development workflow:

https://youtu.be/6pAG3BHurdM?si=qAug4EfiKG_MwnVq (accessed: Sunday, April 07, 2024)

It deserves repeated viewing, whilst following along in the terminal. 

I was watching this YouTube video and I was just amazed by Josean's skills: 

https://youtu.be/6pAG3BHurdM?si=sv4YbsOvqhJNRejT (accessed: Monday, April 08, 2024)

I resolved to give his configurations a try locally. So, I used git to install Josean's Neovim config locally in Termux. I followed this process. 

To download a specific directory from a GitHub repository, you can use the sparse-checkout feature of Git, which allows you to check out only a subdirectory within a repository. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Initialize a new Git repository on your local machine:

```zsh
mkdir nvim-config cd nvim-config git init
```

2. Add the remote repository:

```zsh
git remote add -f origin https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files.git
```

3. Enable sparse-checkout:

```zsh
git config core.sparseCheckout true
```

4. Define the subdirectory you want to check out. In this case, .config/nvim:

```zsh
echo '.config/nvim/*' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
```

5. Pull the specified directory from the remote repository:

```zsh
git pull origin main
```
 
After these steps, you should have only the .config/nvim directory and its contents in your local nvim-config directory.

From what I can ascertain, this process worked well. It replicated the subdirectory repository structure and its contents, recursively, to the letter, where 'tree' is 'nvim'  (which was similarly called by Josean):

```zsh
❯ tree

With the help of generative AI, Internet searches, and extensive trial and error, and ernest tinkering, I 
have managed to get a portion of Josean`s configutation installed locally, and have commenced using it, 
writing some nascent Python:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/s/RQFSs39oKq (accessed: Tuesday, April 09, 2024)

In addition to the new bespoke IDE install, I now know how to have multiple Neovim configurations
and plugin ecosystems in the one environment. I have also learnt how to launch Neovim in default or 
failsafe mode, without any configuration, if it is broken, for example.

There is so much to learn from both Kickstart and Josean, and it will take quite some time integrating 
the learnings, developing with them effectively and efficiently, and eventually truly building my own 
bespoke IDE, for various workflows. This is a significant part of the journey I have set myself on, 
when I commenced the 'A Fable of the Skriptkiddie Scriptoria', shell scripting roadmap, book and project.

I plan to write a function or a script, to automate initialising, and logging on to, different Neovim
configurations on my system, and document it, within the book. Termux has some built-in rudimentary 
terminal multiplexing capability hard-coded into the functionality of the Android application, the 
virtual console. And, watching Josean on YouTube, I now appreciate that the Neovim plugin ecosystem and 
exstensibility, also provides additional, and sophisticated, multiplexing functionality, potentially 
layered on to that of Termux. So, actually extending these, and also using (a) dedicated terminal 
multiplexer application(s), will add a third or even potentially more, multiplexing layer(s). The 
possibilities of Termux for coding, software engineering, developing and hacking, is truly quite 
daunting, as well as incredible, and growing, extending and becomong more sophisticated, all the time. 
So many people have no idea about the facility, amenity, capability and sophistication, of the Termux 
ecosystem, even the technologically inclined. There are no published works of quality to support the 
uptake of Termux. My work will go some way to redress this.

I forked Joseon's repository that contained his Neovim configuration" principally, as I want to 
generate a report of the Neovim config, through Dotfyles, for my own edification, usage, for 
annotation, and for my Skriptkiddie project. 

On generating the Dotfyles report, on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, as follows, circa ten (10) plugins are 
for some reason, not included in the report. So, I will need to annexe these abscences, to the Dotfyles 
report, by hand, following the Dotfyles report output, herewith:

## Install Instructions

Note, this Neovim configuration and its README.md, are dynamic evolving systems and living 
documents, and are bound to change without notice, according to my own whimsy. Given this caveat, 
if you would like to install this config, or give it a testdrive, please find the following code 
to facilitate that, automatically and intelligently generated by the truly awesome:
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). For probity, I recommed that you note the date you implemented it 
for your own records, and this aids auditing its potential makeup, if any parties are interested 
in that information, in future. It is just best-practice and best-modelled.

 > Install requires Neovim 0.9+. Always review the code before installing a configuration.

Clone the repository and install the plugins:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:b9Joker108/my.neovim.config ~/.config/b9Joker108/my.neovim.config
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
```

Open Neovim with this config:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim
```

The deft and dextrous nature of Termux, Neovim and Lua as keyplayers in the Android ecosystem, are 
augmented powerfully by Tmux, which completes the list of keyplayers, in the bespoke IDE 
commandline playfield.

## Weaving a Bespoke IDE Tapestry: Termux, Tmux, Neovim, and the Power of Lua

Imagine an IDE woven from the colourful threads of commandline powerhouses: Termux, Tmux, Neovim, 
and the boundless tapestry of Lua. This isn't your run-of-the-mill proprietary development 
environment; it's a meticulously crafted workspace, sculpted to your desires, and adaptable to 
your workflows. Let's delve into the potentiality and magic of this integrated ecosystem:

**Termux:** Your mobile portal. This Android app grants access to a GNU/Linux environment, 
complete with a package manager and familiar tools like the GNU *NIX mainstay, and other 
commandline FOSS toolsets. It's the foundation stone, the bedrock upon which everything rests.

**Tmux:** The master of sessions and windows. Tmux orchestrates your workspace, splitting panes,
stacking windows, and letting you navigate with lightning speed. Think of it as the architect, 
defining the layout and flow of your IDE.

**Neovim:** The vi or Vim you know, except on designer party-drugs, and further augmented by 
intelligent design and impassioned engineering. Neovim takes the legendary Vim editor (a fork of 
the pioneering and ever-popular vi), giving it a shot-in-the-arm, that results in hacktastic 
superpowers. Extensive plugin support, and a playground for Lua scripting, and asynchronous 
operations, transform Neovim into a versatile and limitlessly customisable, bespoke IDE platform.
The fundamental building block in a GNU/Linux environment is code, and the vehicle of this code is 
the textfile. This textfile forum, yields the granularity and power of GNU/Linux, which was 
fundamentally inherited from pioneering *NIX., definable and redefinableNeovim is the canvas, 
ready to be painted with the vibrant strokes of plugins and customizations.

**Lua:** The brush that paints a thousand extensions. This scripting language unlocks Neovim's 
true potential. Imagine:

* **Language servers:** Syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting for any language, woven
  seamlessly into your workflow.
* **Project management:** Track tasks, manage dependencies, and automate builds, all within your
  editor.
* **Distraction-free writing:** Immerse yourself in pure text, with focus timers and minimal UI
  elements.
* **Custom keybindings and macros:** Craft shortcuts that dance to your fingertips, speeding up
  your every action.

This is just a glimpse into the boundless possibilities. With Lua, the only limit is your 
imagination.

**Critically Narrating the Tapestry:**

While this bespoke IDE boasts immense power, it comes with its own challenges. The learning curve 
can be steep, and esoteric, especially for those unfamiliar with the commandline and vi or Vim. 
Debugging Lua scripts can be tricky, and finding the right combination of plugins can feel 
overwhelming. Additionally, Termux's resource limitations might not suit resource-intensive 
projects.

**Showcasing the Tapestry's Brilliance:**

But for those who persevere, the rewards are manifold. Imagine coding on your phone, tablet or 
other hand-held device, with a full-fledged, yet bespoke and idiosyncratically augmented IDE, in 
your pocket, briefcase, carrybag and/or backpack. Picture seamlessly switching between devices, 
your environment consistent across platforms. Witness the thrill of crafting an IDE that bends to 
your will, a reflection of your unique coding style.

**In Conclusion:**

The integrated ecosystem of Termux, Tmux, Neovim, and Lua is not just a collection of tools; it's 
a blank canvas begging to be splashed with creativity. It's an invitation to weave your own 
bespoke IDE tapestry, a testament to your coding prowess and a playground for your imagination. 
So, are you ready to take the plunge and craft your dream development environment?
