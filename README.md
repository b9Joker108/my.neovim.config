# my.neovim.config

This is a dedicated repository for my Neovim configuration. I decided to place it in its own 
dedicated repository, rather than in my generic and inclusive Dotfiles repository, for ease 
of discovery and visibility.

I am new to scripting, coding and programming. I have specifically chosen Android hand-held 
devices for my scripting, programming and digital endeavours, due to their global ubiquity, 
affordability, extreme ease of portability, customisability and functionality. Termux is the 
most widely used terminal emulator for Android, and is well documented, well supported, and has an 
active development and help community, supporting its use and uptake. For these reasons, Termux 
is central to most, if not all, of my digital and online endeavours. I am documenting and 
diarising my endeavours and learnings with the express intentionality of making them interrogable,
to inform the process and technological uptake and adaptation of others. I am writing a book that
aims to be roadmap, to usefully inform others and to showcase, how to deftly and adeptly acquire 
scripting and hacking propensity in Bash and Zsh, within the Termux terminal emulator environment,
upon Android handheld devices. The example of engineering and iterating, a bespoke, integrated 
developmental environment (IDE), is central and primary to the road this roadmap charts.

If not a user, I have been aware of vi for quite some time, as well as Vim its vibrant fork. But, 
only in late 2023, did I become aware of Neovim through researching potential and prospective 
Android IDEs. Resting somewhat upon intuition and informed faith, I resolved on a Termux 
commandline text editor, that cauld be readily and freely augmented into a bespoke and 
personalised IDE ecosystem, that is functional and powerful and extensible according to an 
individuals workflow, processes and requirements, and yields, maximises and acclimatises, to their
idiosyncrasies. It was due to YouTube, and ..., that my interest in Neovim was initially set and sealed.

# Aspiration for a bespoke Termux commandline IDE

My aspiration, is to create an excellent, intelligent and personalised IDE environment in Termux 
on Android for shell scripting (Bash, Zsh, Sh, Fish, Nushell) and Python programming (initially), 
using Neovim and Lua plugins. I require a combination of plugins for various functionalities such 
as syntax highlighting, linting, autocompletion, git control, etcetera.

# Thanks to YouTube and Kickstart

I initially started my foray into the world of Lua plugins for Neovim, with the Neovim 
configuration kickstarter tool, called Kickstart, and hosted on GitHub, specifically created 
and named, due to its purpose and ain, in providing users new to Neovim, a curated list of Lua 
plugins deemed centeal and primary, to a beginner's journey on starting to use Neovim. I initially
discovered Kickstart on YouTube, and had some problems with it, as one of the plugins in the 
configuration file were not compatible with Android. There were also syntax errors in the 
configuration file. The Neovim subreddit was a readily available and accessible community that 
provided support and assistance in repairing the syntax errors in my Lua plugin Neovim 
configuration file: init.lua.

## The Kickstart Plugins List, at my uptake and implementation of the project, in late 2023

The following Kickstart plugin list, text and formating (along with other nested content and code 
that I have edited, re-worked, re-positionedand and re-purposed) was intelligently generated by
the 'readme' process inbuilt, with much foresight, into the functionality of 
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). I must declare, that I am somewhat in awe, of the simple, powerful 
and elegant functionality of this GitHub hosted website and its markdown. I intend to interrogate 
its markdown, learning from it and pilphering, as necessary.

# Dotfyle website 

I discovered the website Dotfyle, from the Neovim website. Both the Dotfyle and Neovim projects'
websites sourcecode and domain is provided by GitHub, and are  housed in repositories therein. I
plan on using both of them to inform the development of my personal GitHub website. The Dotfyle 
website is an excellent interactive resource for 
finding and comparing Neovim plugins, as well as referencing, resourcing and comparing other 
peoples' Neovim configuration files, it is located at the following address:

## Install Instructions

Note, this Neovim configuration and its README.md, are dynamic evolving systems and living 
documents, and are bound to change without notice, according to my own whimsy. Given this caveat, 
if you would like to install this config, or give it a testdrive, please find the following code 
to facilitate that, automatically and intelligently generated by the truly awesome:
[Dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com). For probity, I recommed that you note the date you implemented it 
for your own records, and this aids auditing its potential makeup, if any parties are interested 
in that information, in future. It is just best-practice and best-modelled.

 > Install requires Neovim 0.9+. Always review the code before installing a configuration.

Clone the repository and install the plugins:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:b9Joker108/my.neovim.config ~/.config/b9Joker108/my.neovim.config
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
```

Open Neovim with this config:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=b9Joker108/my.neovim.config/ nvim
```
